# vineyard #

A work-in-progress hobby OS for the PC.

## Building ##
vineyard uses make as its build tool. In order to compile the kernel, run `make all`. This will download and compile all necessary tools on its first run, which takes about 30 minutes on my machine, as well as actually build the kernel binary.

If you want to clean the tree from object files, run `make clean`.

## Running ##
The build process generates a CD image, which is used by QEMU to boot the kernel. Running the emulator is as easy as running `make test`.

Alternatively, you can run `make test-virtualbox` in order to run it on VirtualBox.

## License ##
vineyard is licensed under the terms of the MIT (Expat) License. For details, see `LICENSE.md`.
